A very noisy loss implies that the learning rate might be too high, while a linearly decreasing loss would suggest that the learning rate may be too low.

We used the initialization `W = np.random.randn(n) / sqrt(n)` where `n` is the input dimension for layer corresponding to `W`. We recommend you stick with the given initializations, but you may explore modifying these.
